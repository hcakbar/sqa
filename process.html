                   </section>

                   <section>
                       <p>
                           To deliver products and services with consistent results, you can implement the Shewhart Cycle, which uses four steps:
                           Plan, Do, Check and Act (PDCA). In the Plan step, state the desired goals for your product and how they will be achieved.
                           The Do step is your implementation of the plan. Once the product is in production, it is time to Check to make sure it is meeting
                           the standard you set in the Plan step. Act requires you and your team to make necessary corrections when the product is not meeting
                           the correct standards.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                           Quality assurance relies on a strict definition of what is acceptable and not acceptable from a product or service.
                           If a customer has ordered a widget from your company that is to be cut into three-inch pieces, then a four-inch piece does
                           not meet the quality standard. A cleaning service may have a standard that calls for bathroom mirrors to be cleaned free of
                           smudges; a fingerprint left behind falls outside of the standard.
                       </p>

                       <h3>Measuring Quality</h3>
                       <p>
                           Measuring the quality that is delivered is critical for consistent results. Managers and supervisors should check an employee's
                           work as it relates to quality standards. When quality falls short, supervisors are responsible for making the change required to
                           bring quality back to the proper standard.
                       </p>
                       <h3>Improving Quality</h3>
                       <p>
                           The old expression, "There is always room for improvement," rings true when it comes to quality assurance. To keep your business
                           on the cutting edge, you should always be asking the question, "How can we make this better?" By tweaking the process here and
                           there or by raising standards a small bit each year, you will see your overall business quality improve to levels greater than
                           you ever imagined.

                           There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form,
                           by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem
                           Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the
                           Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary
                           of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.
                           The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc. It is your
                           responsibility to your company's success to make sure that every employee understands the quality definitions and how he is to
                           make certain those standards are met.
