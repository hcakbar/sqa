                    <p>In developing products and services, quality assurance is any systematic process of checking to see whether a product
                        or service being developed is meeting specified requirements. Many companies have a separate department devoted to
                        quality assurance. A quality assurance system is said to increase customer confidence and a company's credibility,
                        to improve work processes and efficiency, and to enable a company to better compete with others. Quality assurance
                        was initially introduced in World War II when munitions were inspected and tested for defects after they were made.
                        Today's quality assurance systems emphasize catching defects before they get into the final product.</p>

                        is an international standard that many companies use to ensure that their quality assurance system is in place
                        and effective. Conformance to ISO 9000 is said to guarantee that a company delivers quality products and services.
                        To follow ISO 9000, a company's management team decides quality assurance policies and objectives. Next, the company or
                        an external consultant formally writes down the company's policies and requirements and how the staff can implement the
                        quality assurance system. Once this guideline is in place and the quality assurance procedures are implemented, an
                        outside assessor examines the company's quality assurance system to make sure it complies with ISO 9000. A detailed report
                        describes the parts of the standard the company missed, and the company agrees to correct any problems within a specific time.
                        Once the problems are corrected, the company is certified as in conformance with the standard.

                    <p>*There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form,
                        by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of
                        Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum
                        generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.
                        It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which
                        looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic wordsetc.
